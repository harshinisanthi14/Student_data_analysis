# Student_data_analysis
## Introduction

This project analyzes the academic performance of students based on their scores in Math, Science, English, and Attendance using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It calculates total marks, averages, assigns grades, and identifies top performers.

## Dataset Description

Name: Student's name
Math: Marks scored in Mathematics
Science: Marks scored in Science
English: Marks scored in English
Attendance: Attendance percentage

## Technologies Used

Python, pandas – data loading and manipulation, numpy – numerical operations, matplotlib – plotting, seaborn – advanced visualizations, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) – for clean modular code

## Results

The model successfully analyzed student data, calculated totals and grades, identified top performers, and visualized performance patterns. It provides insights into subject strengths and shows how attendance influences academic results.

## Future work

Add more subjects like History or Computer Science, Create an interactive web app using Gradio or Streamlit, Export analyzed results to PDF or Excel, Add filters for subject-wise toppers and attendance analysis
